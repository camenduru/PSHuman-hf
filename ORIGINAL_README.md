Given a single image of a clothed person, **PSHuman** facilitates detailed geometry and realistic 3D human appearance across various poses within one minute.

### üìù Update
- __[2024.11.30]__: Release the SMPL-free [version](https://huggingface.co/pengHTYX/PSHuman_Unclip_768_6views), which does not requires SMPL condition for multview generation and perfome well in general posed human.


### Installation
```
conda create -n pshuman python=3.10
conda activate pshuman

# torch
pip install torch==2.1.0 torchvision==0.16.0 torchaudio==2.1.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# other depedency
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

This project is also based on SMPLX. We borrowed the related models from [ECON](https://github.com/YuliangXiu/ECON) and [SIFU](https://github.com/River-Zhang/SIFU), and re-orginized them, which can be downloaded from [Onedrive](https://hkustconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/plibp_connect_ust_hk/EZQphP-2y5BGhEIe8jb03i4BIcqiJ2mUW2JmGC5s0VKOdw?e=qVzBBD). 



### Inference
1. Given a human image, we use [Clipdrop](https://github.com/xxlong0/Wonder3D?tab=readme-ov-file) or ```rembg``` to remove the background. For the latter, we provide a simple scrip.
```
python utils/remove_bg.py --path $DATA_PATH$
```
Then, put the RGBA images in the ```$DATA_PATH$```.

2. By running [inference.py](inference.py), the textured mesh and rendered video will be saved in ```out```.
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$GPU python inference.py --config configs/inference-768-6view.yaml \
    pretrained_model_name_or_path='pengHTYX/PSHuman_Unclip_768_6views' \
    validation_dataset.crop_size=740 \
    with_smpl=false \
    validation_dataset.root_dir=$DATA_PATH$ \
    seed=600 \
    num_views=7 \
    save_mode='rgb' 

``` 
You can adjust the ```crop_size``` (720 or 740) and ```seed``` (42 or 600) to obtain best results for some cases.  

### Training
For the data preparing and preprocessing, please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10141). Once the data is ready, we begin the training by running
```
bash scripts/train_768.sh
```
You should modified some parameters, such as ```data_common.root_dir``` and ```data_common.object_list```.
